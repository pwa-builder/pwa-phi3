# Phi 3 PWA

This is an example of using [ONNXRuntime](https://onnxruntime.ai/) in a PWA to run Phi 3 on the GPU of your device.

This app also uses the [Fluent Web Components Beta](https://web-components.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/concepts-introduction--page) to achieve a Windows native look and feel for the PWA.

## Run the Example
- git clone https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-phi3.git
- cd pwa-phi3
- npm install
- npm run dev
- The app will open in your browser
